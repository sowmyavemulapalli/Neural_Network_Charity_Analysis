# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis


## Overview Of This Project
    - This project contains the charity data csv data and we do analysis and applied some machine learning strategies on top of this data.
### Purpose 
      - The Purpose of this project is to analyze,and get the improved accuracy on the data using different Machine learning methods.
##  Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis Result
     The results of this project can be discussed in the following way.
      . Data Preprocessing
          - Is_Successful variable can be considered as Target variable in this model.
          - Application_type and Classification variablea can be considered as feature variables.
          -  EIN and Name variables are nei  vzsszzzsazzdzzâ‰ˆxzsxzsxxxsaq		`	EW3Q3Q2W3SWWS			XDSZSxzsszzxdxdxdxdzxdzdxzxzx ther target nor featured variables and are removed from the dataset.

       . Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
          - In the first attempt I have taken 2 hidden layers and 80 neurons for 1st hidden layer and 30 neuron for 2nd hidden layer and relu activation function for input layers and sigmoid for output and accuracy is 0.5331778526306152
          - In the Second attempt,I have taken 3 hidden layers with 20,8 and 5 neurons in each layer and relu activation in all input layers and sigmoid activation in output layer and accuracy is 0.5331778526306152
          - In Third attempt, I have taken the 2 hidden layers with 27 and 10 neurons in each layer and relu activation in input layer and sigmoid activation in output layer and got the accuracy of 0.6960933208465576.
          - I tried to achieve the target performace with three attempts, I am almost close to the target performance.
          _ To increse the performance , I have done 3 attempts. In each attempt I have tried various scenarios to improve the performance and performance also got increased from  0.5331778526306152 to 0.6960933208465576.

    The final output is shown from the above image with the accuracy of 0.6960933208465576.


# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis Summary
  The summary of this project is we did analysis on this  data and analyze  different things using different machine learning models.
  The summary of the results is explained in the below screen shots.
  Different machine learning models can solve this problem. If we use unsupervised machine learning model we may get better performance.so, my recomendation is Unsepervised machine learning model.
